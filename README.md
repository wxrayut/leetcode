    <h1>LeetCode Solutions</h1>
</div>

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository! 

Here, you'll find solutions to various LeetCode problems that Iâ€™ve tackled, written primarily in **C**, and possibly in other programming languages as well. Whether you're here to learn or simply explore, I hope you find these solutions helpful.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

#### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wxrayut/leetcode.git 
cd ./leetcode
```

#### Compile and Run a Solution

Use the provided Makefile to compile and run a specific solution:

```bash
make run file=solutions/<problem>.c
```

#### Check for Memory Leaks

Use Valgrind to ensure memory safety:

```bash
make leak-check file=solutions/<problem>.c
```

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure
